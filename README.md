# privacyIDEA

This module adds flexible, enterprise-grade multi-factor authentication to Nextcloud.
It enables nextCloud to perform MFA against the privacyIDEA server, that runs in your network.
Users can authenticate with classic OTP tokens, and Challenge Response tokens like EMail, SMS, PUSH, or  WebAuthn devices.

## Installation

Copy the directory ``privacyidea`` to your <nextcloud>/apps/ directory or install the privacyIDEA app via the Nextcloud marketplace.
