# privacyIDEA Nextcloud App

This module adds flexible, enterprise-grade multi-factor authentication to Nextcloud.
It enables Nextcloud to perform MFA against the privacyIDEA server, that runs in your network.
Users can authenticate with classic OTP tokens, and Challenge-Response tokens like E-Mail, SMS, PUSH, or WebAuthn devices.

## Installation

Install the privacyIDEA app via the Nextcloud marketplace or copy the directory ``privacyidea`` to your <nextcloud>/apps/ directory.
