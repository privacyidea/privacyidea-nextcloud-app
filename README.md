# privacyIDEA

This module adds flexible, enterprise grade multi-factor authentication to nextCloud.
It enables nextCloud to perform MFA against the privacyIDEA server, that runs in your network.
Users can authenticate with normal OTP tokens, Challenge Response tokens like EMail, SMS and PUSH or using WebAuthn devices.

## Installation

Copy the directory ``privacyidea`` to your <nextcloud>/apps/ directory or install the privacyIDEA app via the nextCloud marketplace.
